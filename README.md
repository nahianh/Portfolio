# **Data Science Portfolio**

A compilation of projects for independent learning purposes and previous courses/internships. 

## Independent Projects
### [Leafly Webscraping and Strain Rating Prediction (in progress)](https://github.com/nahianh/Leafly-Cannabis-Scraping-Modeling)
- Languages: Python (pandas, selenium)
- The goal of this project is to extract the data of each cannabis strain available on the Leafly website and predict the rating and popularity of the strain based on its characteristics.

### [Spotify Song Genre Prediction](https://github.com/nahianh/Spotify-Genre-Prediction/blob/main/Predicting_Song_Genres_based_on_Audio_Features.ipynb)
- Languages: Python (pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib)
- I explore song data obtained from Spotify via the [spotifyr package](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/). I train an ML classifier to predict the genre of a song based on the audio features. Comparing the accuracy metrics of 7 classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGB, I find that XGB results in the highest F1 score among the algorithms. 
  
## Course Projects
### [Detachment and Discipline: The Effects of Federal School Policing Grants on California Secondary Schools](https://github.com/nahianh/Economics-of-Education-Final-Project)
- Languages: R
- I test the claim that school policing negatively affects the learning environment by leading to student detachment in the form of excessive absences and lost instructional time due to exclusionary discipline. Specifically, I investigate the impacts of receiving a federal school policing grant on the chronic absenteeism and suspension rates of California public middle and high schools. Leveraging data on agencies who applied for a COPS Hiring Program (CHP) grant between 2014-2017, I identify a set of treated schools that received the grant and a set of untreated schools whose applications were rejected using a multiple logistic regression model and propensity score matching. Conducting a paired t-test to estimate the mean sample differences in the chronic absenteeism and suspension rates, I find statistically significant evidence that schools receiving the grant experienced higher suspension rates. However, I do not find evidence to suggest that the CHP grant impacts chronic absenteeism.
- This project was completed for ECON146 - The Economics of Education in Winter 2024. 
  
### [SFUSD Survey Analysis](https://github.com/nahianh/SFUSD-Survey-Analysis)
- Languages: R
- I analyze the responses of a survey sent out to San Francisco Unified School District community members. The survey asked respondents about their thoughts on the proposed school closure process in order to determine which factors to consider when identifying candidates for closures, consolidations, and mergers. The goal of this project is to determine which populations are over/under-represented and understand the primary concerns of community members. I find that white individuals were disproportionately represented, while several minority communities, such as African Americans, were underrepresented. I also produced a visualization showing the geographic distribution of responses, finding that the majority of respondents reside in the Ingleside-Excelsior and Crocker-Amazon neighborhoods.
- This project was completed for AFRICAAM112 - Urban Education in Spring 2024. 

## Internship Projects
### [Educational Opportunity Project (EOP)](https://github.com/nahianh/EOP-Summer-Internship)
- Languages: STATA, Python
- At the EOP, I worked on two main projects: 1) gathering, cleaning, and analyzing absenteeism data and 2) PDF scraping, cleaning, and validating kindergarten readiness assessment (KRA) data for the state of Maryland. This repository contains some of the code I wrote for these projects, as well as the results of the absenteeism and learning loss preliminary analysis.
